{# TITLE: CT Angiography #}<p><b>&nbsp;What is CT Angiography?</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;Computed Tomography Angiography&rdquo; (CTA) is a noninvasive heart imaging test. It is used to determine whether either fatty deposits or calcium deposits have built up in the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. It is particularly well suited for you if you have a family history of cardiac events, diabetes, high blood pressure, a history of smoking, and/or elevated cholesterol.</p>
<p>During CTA we use X-ray imaging technology to create detailed images of the arteries around your heart. The procedure is painless, and less invasive than coronary angiogram, or cardiac catheterization.</p>
<p>When a contrast dye containing iodine is used, CTA can indicate arterial stenosis. Without the use of a dye, CTA can detect calcium deposits in arteries, which is an indication of atherosclerosis.</p>
<p><b>What to expect</b></p>
<p>During CTA, you will lie on a padded scan table that slides into scanning equipment shaped like a donut. You will be asked to raise your arms over your head. We will make you as comfortable as possible.</p>
<p>We inject an iodine dye through an IV or catheter in you arm to improve the clarity of the images. This often results in a warm sensation throughout your body. If you have a rapid heart rate or atrial fibrillation, you may also be given a beta-blocker, which slows the heart rate.</p>
<p>While you are inside the scanning equipment, an x-ray tube passes over your body. A technician operates the scanning machine from another room. He or she may ask you not to move at certain times during the test to ensure that the images are clear. After each series of images, the scanning table moves forward slightly and repeats the process.</p>
<p>After the test, a physician who specializes in interpreting medical imaging reviews the scans. Your doctor will discuss the results with you.</p>
<p><b>How to prepare for CTA?</b></p>
<p>You should not have anything to eat or drink six hours before the test. You should also avoid any kind of stimulant, energy pill, diet pill, or medication for erectile dysfunction the day before or the day of the exam. Ask your doctor if you have questions about your medications.</p>
<p>During the exam, you wear a hospital gown. You should remove any jewelry or other metal objects, such as hair clips and belts, which interfere with imaging equipment.</p>
<p><b>Is CTA right for me?</b></p>
<p>CTA examinations are not a replacement for coronary angiograms. It is, however, an excellent method for ruling out significant narrowing of the major coronary arteries and detecting arterial deposits that may lead to future problems without lifestyle changes or medical treatment:</p>
<p>We suggest CTA when:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You are at high risk for developing coronary heart disease, but not showing symptoms</li>
    <li>You are experiencing unusual symptoms that resemble coronary heart disease but are at low risk</li>
    <li>Stress testing techniques have proved inconclusive</li>
</ul>
<p>Summit Medical Group does not recommend CTA if:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You are pregnant</li>
    <li>You have had previous allergic reactions to dyes used during medical imaging, or have allergies to iodine in shellfish</li>
    <li>Your blood pressure, pulse, or other vital signs are unstable</li>
    <li>You have impaired kidney function (for example, because of diabetes)</li>
    <li>You are undergoing radiation therapy for other conditions</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Are there side effects or complications?</b></p>
<p>You can resume normal activities, eating, and drinking immediately after a CTA. However, if you are given a sedative, you should not drive.Your doctor will inform you if you should make arrangements to have a ride home after the procedure.</p>
<p>After the test, you should drink plenty of fluids. This will help hydrate you and flush the iodine dye out of your system.</p>
<p>Complications are rare, but may include allergic reaction to the contrast material, such as a rash, or kidney problems, especially in patients with diabetes. If you have any concerns about these side effects, you should always contact your physician.</p>
<p>If you experience breathing difficulty after CTA, you should seek treatment immediately, as this may indicate a more serious allergic reaction.</p>
