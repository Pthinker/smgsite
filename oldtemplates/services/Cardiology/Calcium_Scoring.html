{# TITLE: Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring #}<p><b>This simple 10-minute screening can find coronary plaque&nbsp;even when a stress test is &quot;normal.&quot;</b></p>
<p>SUMMIT MEDICAL GROUP'S CARDIOLOGY DEPARTMENT presents an exciting new technology in cardiovascular medicine for the ready detection of coronary artery plaque buildup. Many people may be at risk for a heart attack, yet they lack any symptoms to justify the risk of an invasive exam to evaluate their cardiac health. If you are concerned about coronary artery disease, we can help you determine the health of your heart through this simple screening procedure.</p>

<p><b>Here's how calcium scoring works</b></p>
<p>You are asked to complete an assessment questionnaire, and the procedure is thoroughly explained to you. You are asked to lie down on a bed. Your heart is monitored with an electrocardiogram. The scan takes only seconds with no preliminary preparation on your part. It is extremely fast and simple, requiring a single breath-hold. In addition, it is painless and very accurate.</p>
<p>A noninvasive CT (computed tomography) scanner obtains &quot;freeze frame&quot; images of your heart. By using a rapid scan speed and sophisticated computer computer software, a measurement is made of the calcium deposits in your coronary arteries, the arteries that provide blood flow to your heart. The measure of calcium deposits in the wall of your coronary arteries indicates the amount of plaque buildup inside your coronary arteries. Your calcium score is calculated and compared to other men and women of your age giving you a measure of the amount of plaque buildup and your risk of a heart attack.Once the procedure is complete, your doctor interprets the results and helps you understand the information by answering your questions.</p>
<p><b>Who benefits the most for calcium scoring?</b></p>
<p>Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Calcium scoring is best suited for healthy patients who are not having any symptoms, but who may have other risks for future coronary heart disease. People who may benefit from this test include those individuals with any of the following risk factors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Family history of heart disease or stroke</li>
    <li>Diabetes</li>
    <li>Being overweight</li>
    <li>High blood pressure</li>
    <li>Sedentary lifestyle</li>
    <li>High Cholesterol (or low HDL cholestrol)</li>
    <li>Smoking history</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, any individual over 40 years of age, even those without risk factors, may want to consider coronary artery calcium scoring.</p>
<p>By detecting coronary artery disease in its earliest stages, you are given a perfect opportunity to interrupt the course of the disease by changing the risk factors you control. Together with your doctor, behavioral changes can be made which might include an exercise program, a healthier diet and tight diabetic control. By lowering cholestrol and reducing further plaque buildup, you can often avoid the need for future angioplasty or bypass surgery.</p>
