{# TITLE: EECP #}<p><b>What is EECP?</b></p>
<p>EECP stands for &ldquo;Enhanced External Counterpulsation.&rdquo; It is a noninvasive, outpatient treatment for chronic angina, or chest pain and discomfort. With fewer and less intense attacks of angina, you may find that you can be more active and return to many activities that you enjoy.</p>
<p>During EECP we place cuff-like devices on your upper and lower legs. The cuffs inflate and deflate in sequence with the heartbeat, which increases blood flow to the heart. EECP is conducted in a series of 35 one-hour sessions.</p>
<p>Over time, it causes more blood vessels to grow in the heart muscle. Because angina is caused by the heart muscle not getting enough blood, growth of more blood vessels helps relieve angina by helping blood to flow past blocked or partially blocked arteries.</p>
<p><b>What to expect</b></p>
<p>The procedure is not painful and it does not require a recovery period.  During an EECP treatment, you lie on a padded bed. The technician will attach ECG electrodes to your chest to monitor your heart and a plethysmograph attached to your finger to monitor your pulse and blood pressure. The technician will also wrap inflatable cuffs around your calves, lower thighs, and upper thighs. These cuffs look and function very much like blood pressure cuffs. A computer controls the action of the cuffs, inflating and deflating them from calves to upper thigh following the rhythm of the your heartbeat.</p>
<p><b>How to prepare for EECP treatments?</b></p>
<p><b></b>You should avoid any clothing that could bunch up and cause discomfort when the cuffs inflate. Many patients wear athletic tights or bicycle pants.</p>
<p>You should also be sure to urinate before the procedure. In addition, if you take diuretics, you might want to delay taking them until after the procedure. Ask your doctor if you are concerned about skipping regular medication.</p>
