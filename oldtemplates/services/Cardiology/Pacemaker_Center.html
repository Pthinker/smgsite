<p>A pacemaker is a small, lightweight, electronic device implanted inside the body. A pacemaker monitors an individual's heartbeat. When a person's heart does not beat correctly, the pacemaker generates electrical signals to keep a person's heart beating at a normal rate or rhythm. People need a pacemaker when temporary, intermittent, or persistent conditions interfere with their heart's ability to initiate or properly distribute electrical signals.</p>
<h2>Our Pacemaker Clinic</h2>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Although pacemaker batteries generally last for five to ten years before they must be replaced, regular evaluations are necessary to ensure the pacemaker is working properly and/or to determine if the device's settings need adjusting. The role of the Pacemaker Clinic is to help patients maintain pacemaker life optimally by providing high quality care and in depth patient and family education.</p>
<p>The Pacemaker Clinic is under the supervision of the physicians within the Cardiology Department of the Summit Medical Group, P.A. and staffed by nurse practitioners, physician assistants, registered nurses, and medical assistants trained specifically in analyzing pacemaker performance.</p>
<p><b>Benefits</b></p>
<p>Pacemaker clinics help maximize pacemaker functioning for patients who have one. If a patient's heart rhythm changes, the pacemaker's settings may need reprogramming. Pacemakers can also lose their ability to compensate for changes in a patient's activity level. These changes may often be subtle but can have an impact on a patient's quality of life.</p>
<p>Patients who receive timely evaluations may be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>extend the life of their pacemaker,</li>
    <li>identify whether a replacement is necessary and plan for it in advance,</li>
    <li>have the settings adjusted to better help their heart,</li>
    <li>improve their quality of life by maximizing the pacemaker's functioning, overall.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<p>Generally, a patient should have an evaluation of their pacemaker every six to 12 months. However, the actual frequency of visits will be based on the patient's individual needs, the age and type of pacemaker, and the recommendations of the physician. If recommended by the physician, patients may also subscribe to a telephone monitoring service, known as transtelephonic monitoring. Using the telephone in the comfort of their own home, patients can send information regarding the device's programming and battery power to the physicians at Summit Medical Group Cardiology for evaluation.</p>
<p>Clinic visits may include a medical history update, blood pressure check, x-ray, ECG or EKG, and/or a stress test.</p>
