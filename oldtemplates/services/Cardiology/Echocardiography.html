{# TITLE: Echogardiography #}<p><b>&nbsp;What is Echogardiography?</b></p>
<p>Echocardiography uses ultrasound technology to detect a variety of concerns including blockages. heart enlargement, congenital defects, damage from high blood pressure or heart attacks, and problems with the functioning of the heart muscle and valves.</p>
<p>There are two types of echocardiogram. The first, and most common, involves sliding a device over your heart and heart area on the surface of your chest. The second involves inserting a narrow tube into the mouth into the stomach, when more highly detailed images are needed to assess your condition.</p>
<p><b>What to expect</b></p>
<p>Echocardiography lasts less than an hour. It is performed by a registered cardiac sonographer and the results are reviewed by an imaging expert as well as by your doctor.</p>
<p>For external echocardiography, the technician will apply a gel to your chest to improve conductivity of the imaging device (called a &ldquo;transducer&rdquo;). As the technician moves the transducer, you will feel slight pressure. Some patients also experience vibrating sensations. Before the exam you may be asked to exercise on a treadmill to raise your heart rate. During the exam the technician will periodically ask you to remain still or hold your breath.</p>
<p>For &ldquo;transesophageal&rdquo; echocardiography (that is, via the esophagus), you will be given a sedative. You swallow a flexible tube with an imaging device near its tip. The technician will directed the tube from the mouth, through the esophagus, and into the stomach.</p>
<p><b>How to prepare for Echocardiography?</b></p>
<p>For external echocardiograms, you should not eat, drink, or smoke for at least four hours prior to your exam. You may, however, take any medications as usual, unless otherwise directed. If you have questions about your medications you should ask your doctor.</p>
<p>For transesophageal echocardiograms, you should not eat after midnight on the day before your exam. You may, however, take any medications as usual, with the exception of diuretics, unless otherwise directed. If you have questions about your medications you should ask your doctor.</p>
<p><b>Are there side effects or complications?</b></p>
<p>You can resume normal activities, eating, and drinking immediately after an external echocardiogram.</p>
<p>For transesophageal echocardiogram, you should not eat or drink for at least two hours after your exam. You may experience throat irritation. Because you will be given a sedative, you should not drive. You should make arrangements to have a ride home after the procedure.</p>
<p>Transesophageal echocardiography carries a very small risk of throat injury. There are no risks associated with external echocardiography, unless you are asked to use a treadmill. In rare cases, the stress can trigger a heart attack or an arrhythmia.</p>
<p>Please speak with your physician if you have any concerns about these side effects or risks.</p>
