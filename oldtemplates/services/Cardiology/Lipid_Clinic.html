{# TITLE: Lipid Clinic #}<h2>Our Lipid Clinic</h2>
<p>[image: prado.jpg]&nbsp;At Summit Medical Group, our Lipid Clinic has one goal: to help you achieve and maintain the optimal lipid level so you can live a longer and healthier life. Studies have shown that one of the best ways to prevent a heart attack or stroke is to bring your cholesterol levels within the parameters recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program.</p>
<p>We understand that all people are different in their metabolic makeup, their expression of lipid abnormalities, and lifestyle. Therefore, we offer a consultative approach to lipid management where we &quot;partner&quot; with you to develop an appropriate strategy to assist you in achieving optimal lipid levels (i.e., LDL-C between 70 to 100 mg/dL or under 70 mg/dL for people with coronary heart disease or other atherosclerotic disease).</p>
<p>Our Lipid Clinic is a collaborative practice, including Cardiologists, Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants, Nurses, and Dieticians, who all work together to help you succeed at lowering your cholesterol.</p>
<h2>Did you know that...</h2>
<ul>
    <li>High cholesterol can cause heart disease and stroke; both are results of cardiovascular disease, which claims a life every 33 seconds.</li>
    <li>There are 62 million Americans that have cardiovascular disease, which is approximately 1 out of every 5 people in the United States.</li>
    <li>Cardiovascular disease causes more deaths than all forms of cancer combined.</li>
    <li>Cardiovascular disease claims approximately 40% of all the women in the United States.</li>
    <li>75% of people with diabetes die due to heart disease or stroke.</li>
    <li>Cardiovascular disease is sometimes known as the silent killer because at times it has no warning signs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are your risk factors for heart disease?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Smoking cigarettes/cigars</li>
    <li>High blood pressure</li>
    <li>Diabetes</li>
    <li>Inactive lifestyle</li>

</ul>
<h2>What is Cholesterol?</h2>
<p>Cholesterol is an oily, fat-like, waxy substance found in the bloodstream, which contributes to heart disease.</p>
<p><b>There are two types of Cholesterol:</b></p>
<p>The LDL-C (bad cholesterol) particles travel in the blood stream and may stick on the blood vessel walls. This build up, called Plaque, causes narrowing of the arteries and can restrict blood flow, which can cause serious health risk. An increase in the number of LDL particles (LDL-P) means an increase in your risk for cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>The HDL-C (good cholesterol) helps your body get rid of the LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). A higher HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) can help reduce your risk for cardiovascular disease. (For more information, click the following link to our SMG library: <a href="/library/heart_health/blood_lipids/">Blood Lipids</a>).</p>
<p>A <a href="/service/Cardiology/MNMR_Lipo_Profile/">NMR LipoProfile&reg;</a> test will directly measure the LDL particle (LDL-P) number and size and will help identify your risk.</p>
