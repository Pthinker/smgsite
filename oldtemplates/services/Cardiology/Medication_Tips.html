<ul>
    <li>Know what medications you take. Keep a current medication list to keep track of the name, the dosage strength and the timing of medicines.</li>
    <li>Know what each medicine is for. A common mistake is when patients take two medicines from two different doctors that do the same thing. The two medicines may conflict with each other or increase side effects.</li>
    <li>Know the best time of day to take your medicines. Many cholesterol lowering medications, for example, work better if taken at bedtime. We should be able to develop a regimen for your medicines that will fit into your daily routine.</li>
    <li>Know which medicines to take with meals and which to take on an empty stomach. Do not crush, break, or chew time release capsules.</li>
    <li>Know which medicines not to take together, and know how to space out your medication to avoid side effects like nausea or dizziness.</li>
    <li>Let your heart failure practitioner know of all the medication you take. &quot;Medications&quot; include everything you take, such as over the counter cold remedies, vitamins, aspirin, nicotine patches and nutritional or herbal supplements.</li>
    <li>Know how to store your medicines. Many medications are affected by light, others by temperature, still others by moisture Storing your medicines in the refrigerator or freezer is usually NOT a good idea.</li>
    <li>Take your medicines even when you feel well. Heart failure is forever. Our goal is NOT to get you out of trouble once you are already sick. The trick is to stay out of trouble in the first place. The right medication will help you do that.</li>
    <li>Know if you medicines are still in date, especially your nitroglycerine. Call your practitioner if you run out of your medicines. Do not wait until your next appointment to bring this to his or her attention. Plan on refilling your medicines one or two weeks ahead, if your insurance allows, so you will not run out.</li>
    <li>Do not give your medicines to anyone else and do not take anyone else's medicine even if they have the same symptoms as you. Each heart failure patient is unique.</li>
    <li>Report side effects to you health care provider. We need to make sure a symptom is a side effect before you stop taking your heart failure medicine.</li>
    <li>Ask your family to help you remember to take your medicines. It is hard to take more than three kinds of medicines and the average heart failure patient is on at least six medications. Place reminders by the bed, on the bathroom mirror, by the TV or on a refrigerator magnet. Better yet is to put your daily pills in pillboxes that can be obtained at the drugstore.</li>
