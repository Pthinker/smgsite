{# TITLE: Our Services #}<h2>Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring</h2>
<p><img width="75" height="75" align="left" alt="" src="/media/db/image-library/heart.jpg">Many people may be at risk for a heart attack, yet they lack any symptoms to justify the risk of an invasive exam to evaluate their cardiac health. The Calcium Scoring procedure utilizes a noninvasive CT (computer tomography) scanner to obtain &quot;freeze frame&quot; images of a patient's heart. By using a rapid scan speed and sophisticated computer software, a measurement is made of the calcium deposits in the coronary arteries, the arteries that provide blood flow to the heart. The measure of calcium deposits in the wall of the coronary arteries indicates the amount of plaque buildup inside the coronary arteries. The calcium score is calculated and compared to other men and women in the patient's age group and provides the physician and patient an accurate assessment of the risk of heart attack. Any individual over 40 years of age, even those without risk factors*, may want to consider coronary artery calcium scoring.</p>

<h2>Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)</h2>
<p>For our cardiac patients, Summit Medical Group now offers a non-surgical way to find new routes around clogged arteries....</p>
<p><img width="100" height="143" align="left" alt="" src="/media/db/image-library/eecp.jpg">Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP) is a&nbsp;procedure that utilizes specially designed, electronically controlled cuffs which are wrapped around the patient's calves, lower and upper thighs, and buttocks. These cuffs are then sequentially and instantaneously inflated and deflated stimulating the formation of small branches of blood vessels that create a natural bypass around blocked arteries. Painless and relatively comfortable, EECP has proven to be a very successful alternative to surgery for many patients with Angina. If you would like more information, please call our Department of Cardiology at (908) 277-8889.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Non-Invasive Vascular Disease Screenings</h2>
<p><img width="100" height="138" align="left" alt="" src="/media/db/image-library/vascularScreenings.jpg">Vascular screenings are offered at Summit Medical Group. A screening is a test for disease in a person who does not have symptoms of the disease but may be at risk. The objective of screening is prevention.</p>
<p>These convenient screenings are an accurate and inexpensive way to reduce your risk for stroke, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms and peripheral arterial disease. Each screening is a painless procedure that utilizes ultrasound technology. Strokes and ruptured abdominal aneurysms often occur with no prior warning.</p>
<p>Risk factors for vascular disease include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Age</li>
    <li>Family history for strokes, abdominal aortic aneurysms and heart disease</li>
    <li>Smoking</li>
    <li>Heart Disease</li>
    <li>Hypertension</li>
    <li>High Cholesterol</li>
    <li>Diabetes</li>
    <li>Obesity</li>
</ul>
<p>Stroke is a &quot;brain attack&quot;. Strokes, the third leading cause of death in this country, claim the lives of 160,000 and disable 260,000 people each year. Common symptoms of strokes include sudden weakness or numbness on one side of the body, loss of the use or understanding of speech and temporary loss of vision to one eye. Significant cholesterol deposits in the neck arteries called the carotids cause most strokes. These deposits can be seen with the stroke-screening exam. <br>
</br>   <br>
</br>   Abdominal aortic aneurysms kill about 18,000 people per year. The abdominal aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. The abdominal aorta can silently expand in size when its walls get too thin. If the aorta gets too large it can rupture, usually causing death. This expansion of the aorta is usually slow and if seen early enough a rupture can be prevented. The size of the abdominal aorta can be seen with the aneurysm-screening exam. <br>
</br>   <br>
</br>   About 2 million people in this country suffer from peripheral arterial disease. Peripheral arterial disease is the buildup of cholesterol deposits in the leg arteries. Walking may become painful when the arteries become blocked. Significant blockages may cause pain at rest or poorly healing wounds. People with peripheral arterial disease are at risk for heart disease. Comparing the ankle pressures to the arm pressures in a peripheral arterial-screening exam can determine your risk for this disease. <br>
</br>   <br>
</br>   Vascular screening is now available at Summit Medical Group. These screenings provide non-invasive procedures to reduce your risk of stroke, as well as aneurysms and peripheral vascular disease. Through these screenings and the use of ultrasound, all major blood vessels in your body are viewed and evaluated for risk.
