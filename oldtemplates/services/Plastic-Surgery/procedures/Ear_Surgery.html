{# TITLE: Ear "Pinning" Surgery : Otoplasty #}
<p>"Otoplasty" refers to the procedure to correct the appearance
of prominent ears. The goal of surgery is usually to set the ear back
closer to the head or to reduce the size of large ears.</p>

<h2>The Consultation</h2>

<p>Consultation for an otoplasty consists of an extensive
evaluation and discussion of the patient's expectations and concerns. A
history and evaluation of the patient's ears, including photographs,
will be performed. The available surgical options and my
recommendations will be reviewed, including the limitations and risks
of surgery.</p>

<h2>Who Is An Ideal Candidate?</h2>

<p>The best candidates for surgery are children ages 5 and older.
Ears are almost fully grown by this age. It is also the age when
children can begin to get teased about their ears if they are
prominent. This may reinforce a child's desire to have the condition
corrected. Ear surgery on adults is also possible.</p>

<h2>The Procedure</h2>

<p>Surgery may be performed in our office operating room suite or
the hospital, depending on the patient's age. General anesthesia is
normally recommended for children. Adults may have the procedure
performed under a local anesthesia and intravenous sedation. Surgery
usually takes two - three hours. Most commonly an incision is made on
the back of the ear. The ear is sculpted so that a natural appearing
fold is created with ears located closer to the head. Most patients are
discharged home with a head dressing after surgery. This dressing will
need to remain in place until seen back in my office in about one week.</p>

<h2>The Recovery</h2>

Patients are provided with thorough written pre and post operative
instructions. Mostly dissolvable sutures are used. Some discomfort may
be present for a few days. A head band may be required to be worn for a
brief period of time while healing occurs. Swelling may persist for
several months. Limitations in activities may persist for a few weeks.
Patients may return to school or work in about one week.

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Once the swelling has resolved and healing is complete, the
ears will have a much more natural appearance. Besides protruding ears,
there are a variety of other congenital and acquired ear abnormalities
that can be corrected with plastic surgery.</p>
