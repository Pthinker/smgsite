{# TITLE: Chin Implants : Chin Augmentation #}<p>Facial implants may be inserted alone or in conjunction with other procedures to treat bony prominences that need enhancement. The most common areas treated are the chin and cheeks. Implants can often help to balance a patient's appearance. Such as a person with a strong nose but a weak chin. These procedures are performed in our operating suite under a twilight anesthesia. The recovery period is usually limited. The patient may experience some discomfort for a few days and associated swelling. The results are permanent.</p>
