{# TITLE: Laser Hair Removal #}<p>&nbsp;Traditional hair removal techniques such as shaving, plucking and waxing, provide only temporary relief and may actually stimulate hair growth. Electrolysis, while effective, often requires years of ongoing and frequently painful treatments. All of these methods commonly result in scarring, allergic reactions, and ingrown hairs.</p>

<p>Laser hair removal works by targeting the pigment inside the hair follicle without damaging delicate pores and structures of the skin. Because hair cycles through &quot;growth&quot; and &quot;dormant&quot; phases, and because during the &quot;dormant&quot; phase the follicle has no pigment, at least 2 or 3 treatments will be needed.</p>
