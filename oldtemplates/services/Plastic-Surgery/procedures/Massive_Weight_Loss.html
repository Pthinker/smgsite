{# TITLE: Post-bariatric (Gastric Bypass) Body Contouring for Weight Loss Patients #}<p>Patients who have lost significant amounts of weight are the fastest
rising subset of plastic surgery patients. The loss of weight (often
200-300 lbs.) over a period of one to two years often causes an
unsightly deflation of the patient's skin, which can cause problems
with hygeine, difficulty with fitting into clothes, personal
embarassment, and many other pscho-social issues.</p>
<p>These patients now have time-tested solutions available in the form
of skin reduction surgery for the neck, arms, chest, breasts, abdomen
and back, and thighs.</p>
<p>Often, a multi-step approach with the surgeries planned at 2 or 3
intervals is the safest and most effective way of approaching this
problem.</p>
<p>Since the needs and concerns of these patients is very
individualized, it is best to have a personal one-on-one consulation
with one of our board certified plastic surgeons to find out what the
best options are in your particular case, and to create a safe,
workable plan to achieve all of your goals without undue risk.</p>
