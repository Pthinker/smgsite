{# TITLE: Contour Thread Lift #}<p>As of May 2007, the manufacturer of Countour Threads has withdrawn
the sutures and is no longer making the available to physicians. While
we no official announcements were made, we understand that there
weren't any clinical problems with the threads, and their decision was
based on business rationale only. We understand that the parent company
and at least one other company are working on similar products and
improving them to bring this back to market.</p>
<p>Our plastic surgeons may discuss this treatments (some threads are
still available) or alternative minimally invasive techniques with you
during your consultation.</p>
<p>Contour Threads are the only non-absorbable barbed suture product
cleared by the FDA for the elevation and fixation of midface, brow and
neck areas. These specifically designed sutures are fashioned from
clear polypropylene, a material that has been safely used in the body
for many years in other medical products.</p>
<p>As the aging process begins, the skins connective tissue thins and
collagen and elastic fibers begin to break down. As a result, these
changes in underlying support structures appear as sagging, deep
creases, folds and wrinkles in the skin as early as your thirties. Now
there is a simple new technique that makes it possible to rejuvenate
and beautify your appearance.</p>
<p>A lift procedure performed with Contour Threads is a safe,
conservative and effective one that offers subtle, natural looking
results. By gently shifting sagging tissues in an upward direction,
this technique allows the physician to produce a relaxed, fresh
appearance while preserving and enhancing the natural contours of your
face. This procedure does not replace a conventional face-lift; rather
it offers patients an innovative, minimally invasive approach with
immediate results.</p>
