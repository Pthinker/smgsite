{# TITLE: Arm Lift : Brachioplasty #}<p>With aging, and sometimes with weight loss, skin and fat in the upper arm may relax and appear weighty and undesirable. This droopiness is a result of stretching of the support ligaments in the arm. Patients often describe the result as a &quot;bat-wing&quot; or a &quot;loose hammock.&quot;</p>
<p>In very mild cases, liposuction and lipo-sculpting of the arm tissues alone may be enough to remove some of the excess fat and cause the overlying skin to shrink back.</p>
<p>If the degree of droopiness is too severe though, there is no other option than to remove the extra tissues. This is called brachioplasty, also known as an arm lift, and is desined to remove the excess tissue and recreate a more sleek look. The trade-off is that a scar needs to be placed where the extra tissue is removed.</p>
