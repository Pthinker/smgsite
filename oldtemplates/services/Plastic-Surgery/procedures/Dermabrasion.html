{# TITLE: Dermabrasion and Dermaplaning #}<p>Dermabrasion and dermaplaning help to "refinish" the skin's top
layers through a method of controlled surgical scraping. The treatments
soften the sharp edges of surface irregularities, giving the skin a
smoother appearance. Dermabrasion is most often used to improve the
look of facial skin left scarred by accidents or previous surgery, or
to smooth out fine facial wrinkles, such as those around the mouth.
It's also sometimes used to remove the pre-cancerous growths called
keratoses.</p>
<p>Dermaplaning is commonly used to treat deep acne scars. Dermabrasion
and dermaplaning can be performed on small areas of skin or on the
entire face. They can be used alone, or in conjunction with other
procedures as facelift, scar removal or revision, or chemical peel.</p>
