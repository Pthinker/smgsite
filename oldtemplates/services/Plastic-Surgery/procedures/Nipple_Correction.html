{# TITLE: Correction of Nipple Problems #}<p>Many men and women may problems with nipples that are too large or too small in proportion to the size of their chest. Sometimes, the size of the areola (the larger, pigmented skin around the nipple itself) may be excessive.</p>
<p>Often, the procedure to correct the nipple is performed at the same time as another chest or body procedure. If it is an isolated problem, it can usually be treated as an in-office procedure under local anesthesia.</p>
