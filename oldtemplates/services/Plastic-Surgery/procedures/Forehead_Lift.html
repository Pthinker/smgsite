{# TITLE: Brow Lift : Forehead Lift #}<p>Forehead lift is one of the most commonly overlooked
procedures in cosmetic surgery, and yet it can offer among the most
dramatic results. A forehead lift, also known as a brow lift is
performed in order to rejuvenate the upper part of the face, including
drooping eyebrows and prominent lower forehead frown lines. The purpose
of the procure is to produce a less tired and angry appearance. A
browlift may be performed alone or in conjunction with other procedures
such as a facelift.</p>



<h2>The Consultation</h2>



<p>Consultation for facial rejuvenation consists of a thorough
discussion of the patient's expectations and concerns. An extensive
evaluation of the patient's face, eyes and forehead, including
photographs, will be performed. The available surgical options and my
recommendations will be reviewed, including the limitations and risks
of surgery.</p>



<h2>Who Is An Ideal Candidate?</h2>



<p>The best candidate for a browlift is a man or woman whose
eyebrows have begun to sag, making the patient appear tired or sad.
Another indication for surgery is deepened frown lines between the
eyebrows or above the nose. Most patients are in their forties to
sixties, however, some of these changes are hereditary and may be seen
at an earlier age. Forehead rejuvenation is most commonly performed by
an endoscopic approach.</p>



<h2>The Procedure</h2>



<p>The endoscope is inserted through several tiny incisions
located just behind the hairline. The "scope" provides magnification
and allows the surgeon to tighten and lift the forehead and address the
eyebrow muscles as needed. In more severe cases a larger incision
across the top of the scalp may be needed. In cases where frown lines
alone are the concern, they may be addressed through upper eyelid
incisions. Surgery may be performed in our office operating room suite
or the hospital depending on the equipment required. General or
"twilight" anesthesia is recommended for patient comfort. Surgery
usually lasts 1 - 1 1/2 hours. Most patients are discharged home with a
head dressing after surgery.</p>



<h2>Recovery and Results</h2>



<p>Patients are provided with thorough written pre and post
operative instructions. Sutures are normally removed in the office in 7
- 10 days. There is usually surprisingly little discomfort associated
with this procedure. Although it may take several months to enjoy your
final results, the majority of the bruising and swelling subsides by
two weeks. Patients usually are able to return to school or work about
10 days after surgery with some restrictions in their activities. Scars
are usually well camouflaged and rarely visible. The result is often a
more alert and refreshed look.&nbsp;</p>
