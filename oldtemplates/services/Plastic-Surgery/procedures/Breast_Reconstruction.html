{# TITLE: Breast Reconstruction #}<p>Reconstruction of a breast that has been removed due to cancer is
one of the most rewarding surgical procedures available to women today.
Newer techniques and procedures have made it possible to create a
breast that can come close in form and appearance to a woman's natural
breast.</p>
<h2>Who Is An Ideal Candidate?</h2>
<p>Breast reconstruction can be performed at any time following
mastectomy. Most frequently it is performed immediately following tumor
removal (mastectomy). This enables the patient to wake up from surgery
with a breast mound in place, sparing a woman the experience of seeing
herself with no breast at all. Virtually any woman who must lose her
breast to cancer is a candidate for reconstructive surgery.</p>
<p>Reconstruction has no known effect on recurrence of disease in the
breast, nor does it impair the detection of recurrent disease. Breast
reconstruction also does not generally interfere with postoperative
chemotherapy or radiation treatments, if needed.</p>
<h2>The Consultation</h2>
<p>You can begin talking about reconstruction as soon as you're
diagnosed with cancer. Consultation for breast reconstruction is
usually performed in conjunction with the other physicians involved in
the treatment of your breast cancer. This team approach usually
involves your primary doctor, surgeon and oncologist. The Consultation
consists of a thorough discussion of the patient's history,
expectations and concerns. A thorough physical examination and
evaluation of the patient's breasts will be performed. A discussion of
the available reconstructive options, including their advantages and
disadvantages, will be reviewed. An idea of what results you can expect
including the limitations and risks of surgery, will also be discussed.
A discussion of the variables that may affect which procedure is best
for you will also be reviewed. These variables include the patient's
medical history, age, height and weight, body shape, and the size and
shape of the breast to be reconstructed. Photographic examples of the
possible procedures will be reviewed with the patient at the time of
her consultation.</p>
<h2>The options</h2>
<p>Implant reconstruction combines the technique of skin expansion with
subsequent insertion of a permanent implant. Following mastectomy (or
at a later date), a balloon expander is inserted beneath the chest
muscle and skin. The expander is gradually filled with a saltwater
solution over several weeks or months. A tiny valve mechanism is
accessed beneath the skin at regular intervals in the office. After the
skin over the breast area has stretched enough, the expander is removed
in a second operation and a more permanent implant is inserted. A
patient can expect to stay in the hospital for several days following
mastectectomy and expander placement. The patient will have some
drainage tubes in place for a brief time after surgery. The patient can
expect to return to normal activities after several weeks, depending on
the adjuvant therapy needed. The second procedure (removal of the
tissue expander and placement of a permanent implant) is usually
performed as an outpatient. Saline filled implants are used in most
cases.</p>
<p>Flap reconstruction involves creation of the breast mound using the
patient's own tissue. This tissue may come from the back or, more
commonly the abdomen. The tissue remains healthy because it remains
attached to its blood supply. When a woman's abdominal tissue is used
to reconstruct the breast, it is referred to as a TRAM flap. A TRAM
flap consists of skin, fat, and muscle with its blood supply from the
abdomen, which are then tunneled beneath the skin to the chest,
creating a natural breast mound. The abdominal wound is then closed,
giving the woman a "tummy-tuck". An implant is not needed with this
method of reconstruction. A back flap uses the latissimus muscle
usually in conjunction with an implant. The hospital stay and recovery
following this procedure are more prolonged when compared with implant
reconstruction. Patients are able to return to most or all normal
activities following recovery.</p>
<p>Bilateral reconstruction can be performed in most cases, if needed.
Most breast reconstruction involves a series of procedures that occur
over time. Usually, the initial reconstructive operation is the most
complex. The final stage of reconstruction usually involves creation of
a new nipple and areola. In some cases an additional procedure to
enlarge, reduce, or lift the natural breast to match the reconstructed
breast may be recommended. All stages of reconstruction are covered by
most insurance plans. For most mastectomy patients, breast
reconstruction dramatically improves their appearance and quality of
life following surgery.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, post-mastectomy breast reconstruction is not a simple
procedure. There are often many options to consider as you and your
doctor explore what is best for you.Many options are available and the
best way to get complete answers to specific questions that relate to
your individual needs is to have a personal consultation with a plastic
surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.</p>
