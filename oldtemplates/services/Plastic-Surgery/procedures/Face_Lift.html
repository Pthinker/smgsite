{# TITLE: Face & Neck Lift #}<p>Face and neck lift (Rhytidectomy) is performed in order to rejuvenate the face. The goal of facial rejuvenation is to create a natural well rested rejuvenated appearance to the face. The purpose of facial rejuvenation is not to change one's appearance or to create an &quot;operated look&quot;. The areas addressed with rhytidectomy are the jowls, neck, jawline, deep creases around the mouth and sagging cheeks. Any or all of these areas may be addressed. This is done by removing unwanted fatty tissue, repositioning and tightening the underlying soft tissues and muscles of the face and neck, and redraping of the skin.</p>
<h2>The Consultation</h2>
<p>Consultation for facial rejuvenation consists of a thorough discussion of the patient's expectations and concerns. An extensive evaluation of the patient's face, including photographs, will be performed. The available surgical options and my recommendations will be reviewed, including the limitations and risks of surgery. The complexity of the procedure depends on the patient's individual needs. Individual limitations may exist and will be reviewed with the patient preoperatively. Rhytidectomy is often performed in conjunction with other facial procedures such as liposuction, eyelid, brow, chin or laser surgery in order to create a well balanced rejuvenated appearance.</p>
<h2>Who Is An Ideal Candidate?</h2>
<p>The best candidate for a facelift is a man or woman whose face and neck have begun to sag, but whose skin still has some elasticity and whose bone structure is strong and well-defined. Most patients are in their forties to sixties.</p>
<h2>The Procedure</h2>
<p>Surgery is usually performed at the hospital with the patient staying over one night for observation. General or &quot;twilight&quot; anesthesia is recommended for patient comfort. The Procedure involves repositioning and tightening of sagging facial tissues, as well as the removal of excess fatty tissue and skin. The exact procedure is individualized, depending on the patient's needs. After the patient's limited dressings have been changed, the patient may be discharged home.</p>
<h2>The Recovery</h2>
<p>Patients are provided with thorough written pre and post operative instructions. Sutures are removed in the office on about the fifth and eighth postoperative days. There is usually surprisingly little discomfort associated with this procedure. Although it may take several months to enjoy your final results, the majority of the bruising and swelling has subsided by 2-3 weeks. Patients are seen for periodic visits during the first year after surgery.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>After healing is complete patients appear rejuvenated and well rested. Scars are usually well camouflaged and rarely visible. The results following a face and neck lift are long-lasting, however, some people may consider a &quot;retightening&quot; after 5-10 years.</p>
