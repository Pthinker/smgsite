{# TITLE: Laser Skin Resurfacing #}<p>Laser resurfacing involves the use of a carbon dioxide (CO2) laser to treat areas of damaged or wrinkled skin. It is effective at treating fine to medium sized lines, particularly around the mouth and eyes. However, it is also effective in treating facial lines and scars and areas of uneven pigmentation. Often the procedure is done in conjunction with other cosmetic procedures. The goal of laser resurfacing is to create a rejuvenated appearance to the facial skin or areas treated.</p>
<h2>The Consultation</h2>
<p>Consultation for laser resurfacing consists of a thorough discussion of the patient's expectations and concerns. An extensive evaluation of the patient's facial skin, including photographs, will be performed. The available treatment options and my recommendations will be reviewed, including the limitations and risks of laser surgery.</p>
<h2>The Procedure</h2>
<p>Laser resurfacing may be performed in the hospital, however, for cost containment and convenience, it is usually performed in our office operating suite. Laser resurfacing is most commonly performed under local anesthesia with or without iv sedation, especially when it's used to treat localized areas of the face. The Procedure usually takes anywhere from a few minutes to 1 1/2 hours, depending on how large an area is involved. When the imperfections are especially deep, resurfacing in stages may be recommended.</p>
<p>During the procedure, the activated laser is carefully passed back and forth over the skin until a level is reached that will make the wrinkle or scar less visible. The laser delivers a uniform pulse of energy to the skin, resulting in destruction and partial vaporization of the superficial layers. The deeper layers then naturally give rise to regeneration of the superficial layers, resulting in a newer healthier complexion with fewer wrinkles and a smoother contour.</p>
<h2>The Recovery</h2>
<p>It's also important to consider the length of recovery when choosing among the skin-resurfacing alternatives. In general, the more aggressive the resurfacing procedure is, the more prolonged the recovery is likely to be. &quot;Light&quot; resurfacing procedures, such as superficial chemical peels or superficial laser resurfacing, offer shorter recovery times. However, these lighter procedures may need to be repeated multiple times to achieve results comparable to those achieved with more aggressive techniques.</p>
<p>You may experience some mild swelling and discomfort after laser resurfacing. However, this can be controlled with ice packs and medication. Depending on the area treated, the patient's skin may be covered with a bandage or ointments after surgery. The patient will be provided with thorough written pre and postoperative instructions. After about a week or so, you will be provided with instructions on how to gently wash and care for your healing skin. Most patients are free of crusts by about 10 days post-operatively and able to go out in public. Your new skin will usually remain pink to red for 3-8 weeks following the procedure. After about two weeks, most patients can safely apply makeup to conceal this temporary color change. In the months following treatment, it is vital to protect the treated area from the sun until all the color has returned to normal. Using sun protection regularly will help to maintain your results and reduce the chance of any new sun damage to your skin.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Most patients can expect a significant improvement in the quality of their skin and a fresher, smoother appearance. It's important to understand that this is a relatively new procedure and your results will be long-lasting, but not permanent. Remember, your new skin is not immune to the effects of aging. In the months and years following your laser treatment, your natural facial movements will eventually cause any &quot;expression&quot; lines to recur. As with other methods of skin rejuvenation, laser treatments can usually be repeated. However, by protecting yourself from the sun and following a skin-care regimen as recommended by our office, you can help maintain your rejuvenated look.</p>
