{# TITLE: Insurance and Financing #}<p><b>INSURANCE PLANS</b></p>
<p>Non-cosmetic procedures are usually covered by insurance plans if medically necessary. We participate with most insurance carriers (click here for an up-do-date list). For patients whose insurance plans do not participate with us, payment is due at the time of service. Our staff will provide the forms you need to be reimbursed from your carrier.</p>
