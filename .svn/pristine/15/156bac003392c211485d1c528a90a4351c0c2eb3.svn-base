{# TITLE: Breast Lift with implants: Mastopexy with implants #}<p>Many life experiences, such as nursing, pregnancy, gravity, and just simple passage of years can cause a woman's breasts to sag. As the skin loosens with aging, the breasts can lose their youthful shape. In medical terms, droopy or saggy breasts are referred to as &quot;ptosis&quot; of the breasts.</p>
<p>Breast lift, or mastopexy, is a surgical procedure to raise and reshape sagging breasts-at least, for a time. (No surgery can permanently delay the effects of gravity.) Mastopexy can also reduce the size of the areola, the darker skin surrounding the nipple. If your breasts are small or have lost volume - for example, after pregnancy- breast implants inserted in conjunction with mastopexy can increase both their firmness and their size.</p>
<p>In most cases, it is necessary to perform a breast lift (also called a mastopexy). The trade-off of a breast lift is that the plastic surgeon must place incisions on the breasts to lift the nipple to its appropriate location. While this may take care of the sagginess, the patient has to accept that there will be visible incisions lines when she is nude.</p>
<p>If, in addition to droopiness, a woman has also lost volume in the breatss, then it may be necessary to add an implant under the breast lift.</p>
