{# TITLE: Laser Tattoo Removal #}<p>&nbsp;Tattoos, both amateur and professional types, can be removed with several different techniques. In the days before laser treatment, doctors use dermabrasion (basically, sandpaper!) and salabrasion (rubbing the area with high salt concentrations to remove the overlying skin and leech out the dye).</p>
<p>The gold standard now for tattoo removal is the use of color-tuned lasers. With these lasers, over 8-10 monthly sessions, the plastic surgeon can remove most (and sometimes all) of the tattoo pigment from under the skin, without actually cutting the skin over the tattoo.<img width="240" height="83" align="right" alt="" src="/media/db/image-library/Tattoo_Removal_1.jpg"></p>
<p>Professional tattos are usually more reliably removed than amateur tattoos. Be sure to let your doctor know if you have any iron or dye allergies, since breaking up the tattoo under the skin may release pigments to which your body may be allergic.</p>
<p>Although complete removal of the tatto cannot be guarantteed, in most cases, patients experience very favorable results.<br>
