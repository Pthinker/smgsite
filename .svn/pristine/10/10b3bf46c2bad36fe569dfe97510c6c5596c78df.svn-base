{# TITLE: Heart Failure Clinic #}<p>Summit Medical Group's Cardiology department has launched its Live Well Program: The Heart Failure Clinic. Since it's inception in early 2006, the Heart Failure Clinic team has been hard at work at it's main goal-&quot;Turning Heart Failure into Heart Success.&quot;</p>
<h2>Overview of Heart Failure</h2>
<p>Heart failure is the inability of the heart to pump blood effectively to the body. This does not mean that the heart stops working completely. Weakening of the heart muscle can cause heart failure, which can result from high blood pressure, previous heart attacks, valve disease or other problems. Symptoms of heart failure include shortness of breath, feeling tired or run-down, swelling in the feet, ankles and legs, weight gain from fluid build-up, cough, and loss of appetite.</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>This special service will focus on improving your tolerance with activities throughout your day, and help keep you from having to see your doctor for emergency visits. It may also help you to stay out of the hospital. There are also other clinic activities offered such as Patient Lecture Luncheons with other heart failure clinic patients.</p>
<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<p>As a member of the Heart Failure Clinic, you will receive cardiac education and be monitored frequently for your response to your cardiac medications. In addition to your primary care physician and cardiologist, you will be under the care of our Physician Assistants and Registered Nurses at the clinic. Our R.N. Nurse Case Manager will also be assisting you with follow up on your care.</p>
<p>We have found that patients do better when their family understands their condition, therefore, we encourage you to bring your spouse/significant other or any family members to the clinic visits as well. Your first appointment will be approximately 1 1/2 hours in duration. Appointments after that should only take one hour or less.</p>
<p>The clinic focuses on patient education and provider surveillance through a structured set of five educational sessions. These visits include medication adjustment and close symptom monitoring with the physician assistants. Once you have &quot;graduated&quot; from the educational sessions, you will continue to follow up with your cardiologist alternating with the clinic as we work together to improve your quality of life and prevent avoidable hospitalizaitons.</p>
<h2>Registering in Our Program</h2>
<p>To register in our program, a patient must have a written prescription from his or her primary care physician or cardiologist referring him or her to the Heart Failure Clinic.</p>
