{# TITLE: Stress Echo #}<p><b>What is a stress echo test?</b></p>
<p>Stress echo tests use ultrasound technology to assess the flow of blood through the vessels in your heart. Echocardiograms (ECG) of the heart during stress are compared to echocardiograms of the heart at rest. A stress echocardiogram can show heart disease or problems with the heart valves. Your healthcare provider will use it to help decide your need for treatment or for more costly and riskier tests.</p>
<p><b>What to expect</b></p>
<p>The test lasts 30 to 60 minutes. You will be in our offices for one to two hours. A technician attaches electrodes to your chest and back to monitor your heart function throughout the test. First, a resting ECG is recorded. Then the stress test begins. The technician will ask you to walk on a treadmill for the echocardiogram.  The speed and incline of the treadmill increase every 3 minutes, and exercise typically lasts from 5 to 15 minutes, until your heart reaches a maximum predicted heart rate. You are monitored for several minutes after exercise, and then the results will be discussed with you.</p>
<p>However, we may choose to use drugs instead of exercise to produce stress for your heart. Reasons for using drugs rather than exercise are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You have a physical problem that prevents you from walking on a treadmill.</li>
    <li>You have been taking medicine that won't allow your heart rate to increase enough for an exercise test to be useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>When drugs are used to make your heart beat faster, the drug dobutamine is slowly dripped into your vein. A drug called atropine is sometimes given with the dobutamine to increase your heart rate. When you reach the target heart rate or when your healthcare provider decides you have had enough of the drug, the medicine is stopped and a final echocardiogram recorded.</p>
<p><b>How to prepare for a stress test</b></p>
<p>You should not eat or drink anything for about two hours before the test. Please take all of your medications as regularly prescribed on the day of the procedure, except for beta-blockers. Ask your doctor if you should avoid taking any other medicines, tobacco, caffeine or alcohol on the day before the  the test.</p>
<p>You should wear comfortable clothing that allows you to exercise freely, avoiding any clothing that prevents you from moving easily or that risks getting caught in the treadmill.</p>
<p><b>Are there side effects or complications?</b></p>
<p>After the test, you can go home and go back to your usual activities.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, cardiac arrest may occur during the test. To ensure your safety, your healthcare provider will supervise the test. Your blood pressure and ECG will be watched carefully. The test team will watch for and be able to treat emergencies if they happen.</p>
<p>Minor side effects of the drugs are common. Dobutamine occasionally causes chest pain, low blood pressure, or nausea. It may cause or worsen irregular heart rhythms. Atropine may cause temporary dryness of your mouth and temporary blurred vision. Your healthcare provider and the test team are aware of these potential problems and can treat them if they occur.</p>
<p>Please speak with your physician if you have any concerns about these side effects or risks.&nbsp;</p>
