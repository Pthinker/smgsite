{# TITLE: Breast Reduction : Reduction Mammoplasty #}<p>Breast reduction is a procedure to reduce the size as well as lift and shape heavy, sagging breasts. Breast reduction is usually performed for physical relief of symptoms rather than simply cosmetic improvement.</p>
<h2>Who Is An Ideal Candidate?</h2>
<p>Most women who seek breast reduction surgery are bothered by symptoms such as back and neck pain, shoulder grooving, poor posture, rashes underneath the breast and limitations in activities. Unusually large breasts can also make a woman or teenage girl feel very self-conscious.</p>
<h2>The Consultation</h2>
<p>Consultation for a breast reduction consists of a thorough discussion of the patient's symptoms and concerns. An examination and evaluation of the patient's breasts will be performed. Photographs will be taken in cases that require insurance approval. The available surgical options, including a description of how the procedure is performed, will be reviewed. An idea of what results you can expect, including the limitations and risks of surgery, will also be discussed. A discussion of the variables that may affect the procedure--such as your age, the size and shape of your breasts, and the condition of your skin will be reviewed. Some insurance companies and managed care plans will pay for breast reduction if it is deemed medically necessary. Patients will need to discuss with their insurance plan what their eligibility requirements are for breast reduction surgery. In many cases our managed care department may be of valuable assistance.</p>
<h2>The Procedure</h2>
<p>Breast reduction surgery is usually performed at the hospital as an outpatient procedure. Breast reduction is nearly always performed under general anesthesia. The surgery usually takes about three hours and is performed with the help of an assistant. Blood loss during the procedure is usually minimal. The Procedure involves the removal of fat, glandular tissue, and skin from the breast, making them smaller, lighter and firmer. The areola is also usually made smaller and the nipple and areola are lifted to a higher more youthful position. Most commonly the procedure is performed through an anchor-shaped incision. In most cases dissolvable sutures are used and drains are not felt to be necessary. Breast reduction surgery does leave noticeable, permanent scars, although they'll be covered by your bra or bathing suit.</p>
<h2>The Recovery</h2>
<p>After surgery, you'll be wrapped in an elastic bandage over gauze dressings. The bandages are removed a day or two after surgery and you will be placed in a surgical bra to be worn for several weeks, until the bruising and swelling subside. Although most of the swelling disappears in the first few weeks, it may be six months before the breasts settle into their new shape. It may also take up to a year for all of the scars to become less obvious and achieve their final appearance. Patients may be sore for a week or more after surgery. Most women are able to return to work after two weeks following surgery. Patients should avoid strenuous activities and exercise for about four weeks after surgery.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The breasts when fully healed will appear smaller and lifted. A breast reduction, however, won't keep the shape of your breasts from fluctuating in response to hormonal shifts, weight changes, age and pregnancy. Improvement in physical symptoms as a result of breast reduction occurs very quickly. A woman's body often appears better proportioned, and clothes will fit you better.</p>
