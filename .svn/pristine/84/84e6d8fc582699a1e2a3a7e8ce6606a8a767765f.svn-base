{# TITLE: Nuclear Stress Test #}<p><b>What is a nuclear stress test?</b></p>
<p>Nuclear stress tests use radiation imaging technology to assess the flow of blood through the vessels in your heart. Echocardiograms (ECG) of the heart during stress are compared to echocardiograms of the heart at rest. A stress echocardiogram can show heart disease or problems with the heart valves. Your healthcare provider will use it to help decide your need for treatment or for more costly and riskier tests.</p>
<p>Nuclear stress testing is an important test for the evaluation of patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease. A small dose of a radioactive isotope is introduced into your bloodstream intravenously. As you exercise, we observer which parts of the heart muscle receive normal blood flow and which areas have inadequate blood flow.</p>
<p><b>What to expect</b></p>
<p>You will be in our offices for three to four hours. A technician attaches electrodes to your chest and back to monitor your heart function throughout the test. First, a resting ECG is recorded. Then the stress test begins. The technician will ask you to walk on a treadmill for the echocardiogram, until your heart reaches a maximum predicted heart rate. Repeat imaging will be performed following the exercise portion of your test. Your doctor will discuss results with you.</p>
<p><b>How to prepare for a nuclear stress test</b></p>
<p>You should not eat or drink anything for at least four hours before the test. Please take all of your medications as regularly prescribed on the day of the procedure, except for beta-blockers. Ask your doctor if you should avoid taking any other medicines, tobacco, caffeine or alcohol on the day before the  the test.</p>
<p>You should wear comfortable clothing that allows you to exercise freely, avoiding any clothing that prevents you from moving easily or that risks getting caught in the treadmill.</p>
<p><b>Are there side effects or complications?</b></p>
<p>After the test, you can go home and go back to your usual activities.</p>
<p>There are no known side effects or allergic reactions from the radionuclides used. On rare occasions, cardiac arrest may occur during the test. To ensure your safety, your healthcare provider will supervise the test. Your blood pressure and ECG will be watched carefully. The test team will watch for and be able to treat emergencies if they happen.</p>
<p>Please speak with your physician if you have any questions or concerns.&nbsp;</p>
