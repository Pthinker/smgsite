{# TITLE: Breast Lift : Mastopexy #}<p>Breast lift, or &quot;mastopexy&quot; is a procedure to lift and reshape sagging breasts. Sagging breasts may be the result of pregnancy, nursing or age (due to the effects of gravity). As the skin loses its elasticity, the breasts often lose their shape and firmness and begin to sag.</p>
<h2>Who Is An Ideal Candidate?</h2>
<p>The best candidates for breast lift are women with small, sagging breasts. Breasts of any size can be lifted, but the results may not last as long in heavy breasts. Larger breasted women may require a breast reduction in order to lift their breasts. If your breasts are small or have lost volume--for example, after pregnancy--breast implants may need to be inserted in conjunction with mastopexy to increase both their firmness and their size. Mastopexy is usually not recommended if you are planning on having more children, because pregnancy is likely to stretch your breasts again and offset the results of the procedure.</p>
<h2>The Consultation</h2>
<p>Consultation for a breast lift consists of a thorough discussion of the patient's desires and concerns. An examination and evaluation of the patient's breasts will be performed. The available surgical options, including a description of how the procedure is performed, will be reviewed. An idea of what results you can expect, including the limitations and risks of surgery, will also be discussed. A discussion of the variables that may affect the procedure--such as your age, the size and shape of your breasts, the condition of your skin, and whether an implant is advisable, will be reviewed.</p>
<h2>The Procedure</h2>
<p>Breast lift may be performed in our office operating suite or as an outpatient at the hospital. Either local anesthesia with intravenous sedation or general anesthesia may be used. The surgical technique used and the location of the incisions depends on the patient's anatomy and the amount of lift required. The nipple and breast are raised and excess skin is removed. The new breast will be higher and firmer. Every effort will be made to assure that the incision is placed so resulting scars will be as inconspicuous as possible. Mastopexy does leave noticeable, permanent scars, although they'll be covered by your bra or bathing suit. Some patients, especially those with relatively small breasts and minimal sagging, may be candidates for modified procedures requiring less extensive incisions. If you're having an implant inserted along with your breast lift, it will be placed in a pocket directly under the breast tissue, or deeper, under the muscle of the chest wall. In most cases dissolvable sutures are used and drains are not felt to be necessary. Mastopexy usually takes one and a half to three hours.</p>
<h2>The Recovery</h2>
<p>After surgery, you'll wear an elastic bandage or a surgical bra over gauze dressings. Patients may be sore for a period of time after surgery. Bruising is usually minimal. Swelling may last for a few weeks to several months. Most patients are able to return to work in one to two weeks following surgery. Patients may be required to wear a surgical bra and limit their activities for several weeks following surgery.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>You should also keep in mind that a breast lift won't keep you firm forever--the effects of gravity, pregnancy, aging, and weight fluctuations will eventually take their toll again. Women who have implants along with their breast lift may find the results last longer.</p>
