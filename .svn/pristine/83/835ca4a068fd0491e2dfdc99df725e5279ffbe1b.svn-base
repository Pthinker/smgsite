<p><b>Abdominal Ultrasound for Abdominal Aneurysm</b></p>
<p><b></b>The aorta is an artery, meaning it carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart. Abnormal enlargement or bulging of the aorta is referred to as an aortic aneurysm. An aneurysm occurs when a segment of the vessel becomes weakened. The pressure of the blood flowing through the vessel creates a bulge at the weak spot, much as an overinflated inner tube can cause a bulge in a tire. The bulge may grow with time. Aneurysms are dangerous because they can rupture, causing internal bleeding. They are most common in the arteries of the brain and in the abdominal aorta. An abdominal ultrasound may show abnormalities in the shape of your aorta.</p>
<p><b>Blood Pressure</b></p>
<p>Blood is carried from the heart to all parts of your body in vessels called arteries. Blood pressure is the force of the blood pushing against the walls of the arteries. Each time the heart beats (about 60-70 times a minute at rest), it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is at its highest when the heart beats. This is called systolic pressure. When the heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is the diastolic pressure. High blood  pressure - also called hypertension - is a major health problem in the world today. Hypertension is sometimes called &quot;the silent killer&quot; because it doesn't have any symptoms, yet it can cause serious damage. It is a primary cause of stroke, heart disease, heart failure, kidney disease, and blindness. Hypertension triples a person's chance of developing heart disease, and boosts the chance of strokes seven times and the chance of congestive heart failure six times.</p>
<p><b>Blood Sugar</b></p>
<p>Blood sugar tests measure how well your body processes sugar (glucose). Some blood sugar tests are used to diagnose prediabetes or diabetes. Others determine how well you're managing your diabetes. A fasting blood sugar test measures the amount of sugar in your blood after you fast for at least eight hours or overnight. Normal fasting blood sugar result is lower than 100 milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dL). If your fasting blood sugar level is 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL, you have impaired fasting glucose &mdash; commonly known as prediabetes. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may repeat the fasting blood sugar test several days to a week later.</p>
<p><b>Bone Density Scan for Osteoporosis</b></p>
<p>Early detection of low bone mass (osteopenia) or osteoporosis is the most important step for prevention of osteoporotic bone fractures. If osteopenia or osteoporosis has occurred, a person can take action to stop the progression of bone loss.  One way to test the strength and solidness of the bones is with bone mineral density (BMD) tests. Bone mineral density tests measure the solidness and mass (bone density) in the spine, hip, and/or wrist, which are the most common sites of fractures due to osteoporosis. Other tests measure bone density in the heel or hand. These tests are performed like x-rays. They are painless, noninvasive, and safe. The risk of radiation is very minimal, much less than even having a chest x-ray film.</p>
<p><b>Cholesterol</b></p>
<p>Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that occurs naturally in all parts of the body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries. This is called plaque. Plaque can narrow your arteries or even block them. To travel in the bloodstream, cholesterol is carried in small packages called lipoproteins (lip-o-PRO-teens). The small packages are made of fat (lipid) on the inside and proteins on the outside. Two kinds of lipoproteins carry cholesterol throughout your body. It is important to have healthy levels of both:</p>
<p>Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is sometimes called bad cholesterol.&nbsp;High LDL cholesterol leads to a buildup of cholesterol in arteries. The higher the LDL level in your blood, the greater chance you have of getting heart disease.</p>
<p>High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is sometimes called good cholesterol. HDL carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. The liver removes the cholesterol from your body. The higher your HDL cholesterol level, the lower your chance of getting heart disease.</p>
<p><b>Colonoscopy</b></p>
<p>A colonoscopy allows a doctor to look inside the entire large intestine. The procedure enables the physician to see things such as inflamed tissue, abnormal growths, and ulcers. It is most often used to look for early signs of cancer in the colon and rectum. It is also used to look for causes of unexplained changes in bowel habits and to evaluate symptoms like abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and weight loss. You will be given instructions in advance that will explain what you need to do to prepare for your colonoscopy. Your colon must be completely empty for the colonoscopy to be thorough and safe. The doctor can remove most abnormal growths in your colon, like a polyp, which is a growth in the lining of the bowel. Polyps are removed using tiny tools passed through the scope. Most polyps are not cancerous, but they could turn into cancer. The doctor can also remove tissue samples to test in the lab for diseases of the colon (biopsy). In many cases, a colonoscopy allows for accurate diagnosis and treatment of colon abnormalities without the need for a major operation.</p>
<p><b>HIV Testing</b></p>
<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV attacks the body&rsquo;s immune system and leads to AIDS. People with AIDS develop many diseases and &ldquo;opportunistic&rdquo; infections (such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, cancer, and skin infections). There is no cure for HIV/AIDS. If you have been exposed to the HIV virus in any number of ways, you can be tested to see if you have the HIV antibodies. Many reasons exist to have an HIV test performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Take advantage of early treatment and monitoring.</li>
    <li>The life expectancy of a person infected with HIV has greatly increased over the past 10 years because of new treatments and prevention of opportunistic infections.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Early medical attention can slow the growth of HIV. The slower the virus spreads, the longer your body will be able to ward off the illnesses that often accompany AIDS.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Mammogram</b></p>
<p>A mammogram is a safe test used to look for any problems with a woman's breasts. The test uses a special, low-dose x-ray machine to take pictures of both breasts. The results are recorded on x-ray film or directly onto a computer for a radiologist to examine. Mammograms allow the doctor to have a closer look for breast lumps and changes in breast tissue. They can show small lumps or growths that a doctor or woman may not be able to feel when doing a clinical breast exam.</p>
<p><b>Pap Smear</b></p>
<p>The Pap test, also called a Pap smear, checks for changes in the cells of your cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that opens into the vagina. The Pap test can tell if you have an infection, abnormal cervical cells, or cervical cancer. It can find the earliest signs of cervical cancer - a common cancer in women. If caught early, the chance of curing cervical cancer is very high. Pap tests can also find infections and abnormal cervical cells that can develop into cancer cells. Treatment can prevent most cases of cervical  cancer from developing.</p>
<p><b>Prostate cancer</b></p>
<p>The prostate is a glandular organ present only in males. The prostate is normally about 3 cm long (slightly more than 1 inch) and lies at the neck of the bladder and in front of the rectum. Almost all prostate cancers arise from the secretory glandular cells in the prostate. Prostatic specific antigen (PSA) is an enzyme produced by both normal and abnormal prostate tissues. It may be elevated in benign conditions, such as prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) and benign prostatic hypertrophy, as well as in cancer of the prostate. PSA values may be more helpful over time in following recurrence of cancer and the response to therapy than in diagnosing a previously unknown cancer.</p>
