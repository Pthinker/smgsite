{# TITLE: Tummy Tuck : Abdominoplasty #}<p>Abdominoplasty, known more commonly as a "tummy tuck," is a major
surgical procedure to remove excess skin and fat from the middle and
lower abdominal and to tighten the muscles of the abdominal wall. The
procedure can dramatically reduce the appearance of a protruding
abdomen.</p>
<h2>The Consultation</h2>
<p>Consultation for abdominoplasty consists of a thorough discussion of
the patient's desires and concerns. An extensive evaluation of the
patient's abdomen and body contour, including photographs, will be
performed. The available surgical options and my recommendations will
be reviewed, including the limitations and risks of surgery.
Abdominoplasty may be performed in conjunction with liposuction or
gynecological procedures.</p>
<h2>Who Is An Ideal Candidate?</h2>
<p>The best candidates for abdominoplasty are men or women who are in
relatively good shape but are bothered by a large fat deposit or loose
abdominal skin that won't respond to diet or exercise. The surgery is
particularly helpful to women following pregnancy. Pregnancy often
causes the abdominal muscles and skin to stretch and they often fail to
regain their original tone. Loss of skin elasticity in older patients,
which frequently occurs with slight obesity, can also be improved.
Patients who intend to lose a lot of weight should postpone the
surgery. Also, women who plan future pregnancies should wait, as
vertical muscles in the abdomen that are tightened during surgery can
separate again during pregnancy.</p>
<h2>The Procedure</h2>
<p>Abdominoplasty is usually performed at the hospital under a general
anesthesia. Patients are commonly admitted for a few days
post-operatively The Procedure consists of removing excess skin and fat
between the belly button and the pubis along with tightening of the
abdominal muscles. In certain cases a "mini" type abdominoplasty may be
performed in our office operating suite, requiring less anesthesia and
an easier recovery.</p>
<h2>The Recovery</h2>
<p>Following discharge some patients may have drains in place for
several days. Most sutures are dissolvable and do not need to be
removed. Return to normal activities is slow. Most people remain out of
work for 2-3 weeks. The abdominal scar while long in some cases, is
kept in the bikini line and will not show in most clothing and swim
wear.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Abdominoplasty, whether partial or complete, produces excellent
results for patients with weakened abdominal muscles or excess skin.
Some women may choose to also undergo liposuction of their hips or
other regions at the same time in order to achieve a more optimum
result. In most cases, the results following abdominoplasty are long
lasting, provided you follow a balanced diet and exercise regularly.</p>
