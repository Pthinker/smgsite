{# TITLE: Controlling Heart Failure #}<h2>Control Other Medical Problems You May Have:</h2>
<p><b>Control Your Blood Pressure</b></p>
<p>High Blood pressure is one of the major causes of heart failure. Once you have heart failure, it is even more important to keep your blood pressure down. If you have high blood pressure, your heart muscle has a harder time emptying itself, so it pumps less blood to your body. Some blood pressure medicines also help your heart failure; others make heart failure worse. Your healthcare practitioner will help you pick the right blood pressure medicines for you.</p>
<p>Even a blood pressure that is normal for some people may be too high for someone with heart failure. The lower the better with heart failure patients, unless you become dizzy, or have symptoms of low cardiac output. If your heart muscle is weak, lower blood pressure will reduce the work of your heart.</p>

<h2>Control Your Blood Sugar if You Have Diabetes</h2>
<p>Poorly controlled blood sugar can lead to problems healing and fighting off infections, worsening of blockages in your blood vessels, kidney problems, and worsening eye problems. In summary, poorly controlled blood sugar leads to poor general health, and this will certainly impact your heart failure.</p>

<h2>Control Your Cholesterol</h2>
<p>High cholesterol can lead to plaque buildup in your arteries known as atherosclerosis. If the arteries of your heart have serious blockages, your heart muscle is starved for blood and can't function as well. To prevent atherosclerosis, we recommend the following guidelines:</p>
<p>LDL cholesterol is the &quot;bad cholesterol&quot;. The number that we recommend you lower it to is different depending on your risk category for cardiac events. Know your risk category and what your goal LDL number is.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk Category&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">LDL Goal</span></span></p>
<p>High Risk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70-100</p>
<p>Moderately&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;130</p>
<p>Low&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;160</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b></p>
<p>The heart can be compared to a house, with various systems for plumbing, electricity etc. While the &quot;plumbing&quot; and &quot;electrical circuitry of your heart are separate systems from the main muscle function of your heart, all of these systems exist together, side by side. If the arteries of your heart have serious blockages, your heart muscle is starved for blood and cannot function as well. If your heart rhythm is poorly controlled, then your heart muscle pumping chambers have less time to fill up between beats, so less blood is pumped forward, worsening your heart failure. Part of the treatment of your heart failure, might not be aimed directly at your failing heart muscle, but rather at improving your overall heart health. You can do this by keeping your cholesterol controlled, getting your heart rate or rhythm controlled, taking your flu and pneumonia vaccines, taking your lung medicines properly.</p>
<h2>Lifestyle Changes:</h2>
<p><b>Avoid Alcohol:</b> Alcohol depresses your heart muscle's ability to contract, making it harder for your heart to pump normally. In fact, regular use of alcohol can cause heart failure. In addition, alcohol can cause rhythm problems. Alcohol lowers your blood pressure in the short term and causes high blood pressure in the long term. As important as the direct toxic effects of alcohol are, alcohol can also impair your judgment so you do not do other things to help your heart. You may have heard that one to two glasses of red wine a day are good for your heart, but if you have heart failure, NO ALCOHOL is best. You can get many of the same benefits of one glass of wine from three glasses of grape juice.</p>
<p><b>Get to Your Ideal Body Weight:</b> Each extra pound you carry is an extra load on your heart. Being overweight can worsen your high blood pressure, worsen your blood sugar and raise your blood cholesterol and blood triglycerides. Being overweight can cause swelling in your ankles and cause you to be short of breath. Being overweight does nothing good for you or your heart. If you are overweight, losing 10% of your body weight can have a tremendous benefit on your heart risk.</p>
<p><b>Stay as Active as You Can:</b> Rest is an important part of the treatment of heart failure, but so is exercise. Being active will make many parts of your treatment easier to handle, but you should not push yourself to exhaustion. Pushing yourself too hard will just make your heart failure worse. A program of walking or water exercise is all you need to keep your heart healthy. There are several general rules on how to gauge moderate exercise. For example, when you are walking, if you can sing you are going too slowly. If you cannot talk comfortably, you are going too fast. Remember you are not training for the Olympics; you are just trying to keep your heart in shape.</p>
<p><b>Stop Smoking:</b> Usually we associate smoking with blockages in the coronary arteries, but smoking can worsen your heart failure as well. Smokers may ignore warning signs of hear failure, such as being short of breath or coughing. The chemicals in cigarette smoke also raise your heart rate and blood pressure, worsening heart failure in some cases.</p>
