{# TITLE: Eyelid surgery : Blepharoplasty #}<p>Blepharoplasty is performed in order to correct the cosmetic appearance of &quot;droopy&quot; upper and/or &quot;baggy&quot; lower eyelids. The goal of blepharoplasty surgery is to create a natural, less tired and rejuvenated appearance to the eyes. Excess eyelid fat, redundant skin and muscle may removed. In some cases blepharoplasty may need to be performed for medical reasons which may be covered by some insurance plans. Blepharoplasty may be performed alone or in conjunction with other procedures.</p>
<h2>The Consultation</h2>
<p>Consultation for blepharoplasty consists of an extensive evaluation and discussion of the patient's expectations and concerns. A history and evaluation of the patient's eyes and eyelids including photographs, will be performed. The available surgical options and my recommendations will be reviewed, including the limitations and risks of surgery.</p>
<h2>Who Is An Ideal Candidate?</h2>
<p>The best candidates for eyelid surgery are men and women who are physically healthy, psychologically stable, and realistic in their expectations. Most are 35 or older, but if droopy, baggy eyelids run in your family, you may decide to have eyelid surgery at a younger age.</p>
<h2>The Procedure</h2>
<p>Surgery is usually performed in our office operating suite. In most cases surgery is performed under local anesthesia and intravenous sedation. This allows the patient to remain awake, yet relaxed, and insensitive to pain. Several different surgical techniques are available depending on the patient's needs. In some cases the procedure can be performed without any external incisions. A laser may also be used. Surgery usually takes under two hours. The patient will be provided with thorough written pre and postoperative instructions.</p>
<h2>Recovery and Results</h2>
<p>Discomfort after blepharoplasty is usually limited. Sutures, if used, are removed in about 5 days. Most swelling and bruising resolves within 10-14 days. In most cases results will last for years and may be permanent. Scars are usually well camouflaged and rarely visible.</p>
