{# TITLE: Labial Reduction: Female Plastic Surgery #}<p>Enlargement and lengthening of the labia minora or the labia majora can sometimes happen on one or both sides. This is not only cosmetically bothersome to some women, but can also be functionally problematic, causing irritation, difficulty sitting, problems with hygiene, inability to wear particular types of bikinis, and personal embarassment.</p>
<p>Labial reduction procedures treat this problem with restoration of a more youthful appearance to the female genital area.</p>
