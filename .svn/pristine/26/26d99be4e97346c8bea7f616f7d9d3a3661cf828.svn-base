{# TITLE: Skin Care #}{# KEYWORDS: peel contour #}<p>&nbsp;The Plastic Surgery Center welcomes the services of medical aesthetician, Betsy Yeleck. A medical aesthetician is a licensed skin care professional that works with healthcare providers. In addition to studying for and obtaining their skin care license, a medical aesthetician is intimately familiar with the anatomy, biology, and chemistry of the skin. Working under the supervision of our board-certified plastic surgeons, Betsy provides clinical expertise in the area of skin analysis, treatment and care.</p>

<p>Before cosmetic or plastic surgery, Betsy can assist in discussing pre-and-post operative needs and concerns with patients. Additionally, she is trained to evaluate medical clearance needs before surgery, and can inform patients of necessary lab or pre-operative testing. After a cosmetic or plastic surgery, Betsy can recommend post-operative care and products that are of medical grade quality to facilitate the healing process.</p>
<p>The goals of our program are to enhance the appearance of the skin by softening the texture, smoothing irregularities, and brightening the complexion.</p>
<p><b>The Consultation</b></p>
<p>Patients interested in our program are seen and evaluated by a qualified nurse. Once the patient is evaluated, a detailed program is outlined. We can customize a skin care program through in-office treatments (peels) and/or home care products specifically to fit your needs.</p>
<p><b>Home Care Program</b></p>
<p>Our home care program consists of cleansers, alpha hydroxy acids, pigmentation creams, acne products, moisturizers, sunscreen and make-up. Each product line has been researched and chosen because of its efficiency and safety.</p>
<p><b>Office Peels</b></p>
<p>Office peels are also available in varying strengths. &quot;Lunch time&quot;peels involve the application of a high concentration of glycolic acid performed by our skin care nurse. The result is an improvement in skin contour, complexion, smoothness and overall appearance.</p>
