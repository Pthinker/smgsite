{# TITLE: Breast Augmentation #}<p>Breast augmentation is the name of the surgical procedure performed
in order to enhance or enlarge a woman's breasts with the use of breast
implants. Saline-filled implants are used almost exclusively for breast
augmentation.</p>
<h2>Who Is An Ideal Candidate?</h2>
<p>The best candidates for breast augmentation are women who desire to
enhance their body contour and feel their breast size is too small.
Breast augmentation may help a women to feel more self-confident about
her body image. Breast augmentation can also correct slightly sagging
breasts or breasts that have lost volume due to pregnancy. The goal of
surgery usually is to create a natural fuller breast rather than one
that appears "over augmented". Women that have a breast asymmetry,
congenital abnormalities or have undergone a previous mastectomy may
also be good candidates for breast augmentation.</p>
<h2>The Consultation</h2>
<p>Consultation for breast augmentation consists of a thorough
discussion of the patient's desires and concerns. An examination and
evaluation of the patient's breasts will be performed. The available
surgical options, including a description of how the procedure is
performed, will be reviewed. An idea of what results you can expect,
including the limitations and risks of surgery, will also be discussed.
The types and shapes of the available breast implants will also be
discussed. Presently, most breast implants used for breast augmentation
are saline-water filled. Patients must be aware of the potential risks
associated with breast augmentation surgery. These risks will be
reviewed with you at the time of your consultation.</p>
<h2>The Procedure</h2>
<p>Breast augmentation may be performed in our office operating suite
or as an outpatient at the hospital. Either intravenous sedation or
general anesthesia may be used. The location of the incision used
depends on the patient's anatomy and desires. Every effort will be made
to assure that the incision is placed so resulting scars will be as
inconspicuous as possible. The most common incisions are usually
located underneath the breast in the natural crease or under the arm.
Through these incisions a pocket is created behind the breast, the
implant is placed either behind or in front of the chest muscle,
depending on the patient's anatomy and the type of implant selected. In
most cases dissolvable sutures are used and drains are not felt to be
necessary. Surgery usually take less than two hours.</p>
<h2>The Recovery</h2>
<p>Patients may be sore for a period of time after surgery. Bruising is
usually minimal, however, swelling may last for several weeks. Most
patients are able to return to work within one week after surgery.
Patients may be required to wear a surgical bra and limit their
activities for a few weeks following surgery.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>For most women, the result of breast augmentation is extremely
satisfying, even exhilarating, as they learn to appreciate their fuller
appearance. Regular examination and routine mammograms for those in the
appropriate age groups at prescribed intervals will help assure that
any complications, if they occur, can be detected early and treated.</p>
