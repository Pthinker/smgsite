{# TITLE: Coumadin Care Center #}<h2>Outpatient Anticoagulant Clinic</h2>
<p><b>Overview of Coumadin</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CoumadinTM is an oral anticoagulant medication, commonly referred to as a blood thinner. The generic name for Coumadin is Sodium Warfarin. Coumadin is used to prevent the formation of blood clots that can cause heart attack, stroke, or blood vessel blockages in various parts of the body. Many patients are prescribed Coumadin or other anticoagulant medications because they have conditions that increase their risk of blood clot-related complications, such as atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and peripheral vascular disease.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Our Coumadin Care Center</b></h2>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The role of the Coumadin Care Center is to effectively manage and educate patients who are on oral anticoagulation therapy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Coumadin is a life-saving medication, the safe use of Coumadin requires careful monitoring and dosage adjustment based on Protime/INR blood tests. The amount of Coumadin an individual should take can vary depending on many factors, such as a patient's medical condition, diet, and lifestyle. Patients visit the clinic usually every 2-4 weeks and determine if their dosage needs to be adjusted. The Coumadin Care Center is under the supervision of Cardiologists in the Cardiology Department of the Summit Medical Group and staffed by nurse practitioners, physician assistants, registered nurses, and medical assistants trained specifically in anticoagulation therapy. Each patient continues under the care of their primary care physician and the Coumadin Care Center is responsible only for adjustment in Coumadin dosage.</p>
<p><b>Benefits</b></p>
<p>Studies have shown that patients who participate in clinics that provide a systematic and standardized approach to managing anticoagulation therapy are more compliant and, therefore, have a lower incidence of hemorrhage, heart attack, and stroke.</p>
<p>We also provide patients and their families with counseling and educational materials on subjects, such as potential drug- to-drug interactions and side affects, which are necessary to achieve and maintain appropriate Coumadin control.</p>
<p>We use the more painless fingerstick method of blood sampling rather than drawing blood in the traditional manner. Using our on-site lab, we can provide a patient's test results within two minutes. At that time, patients will receive written results, instructions, and the next appointment will be scheduled. Routine visits take less than 15 minutes.</p>
