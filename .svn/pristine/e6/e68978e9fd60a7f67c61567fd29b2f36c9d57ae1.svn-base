{# TITLE: Nose Surgery : Rhinoplasty #}<p>Rhinoplasty is the name of the procedure used to improve the appearance of the nose. Rhinoplasty can reduce or increase the size of your nose, change the shape of the tip or the bridge, narrow the span of the nostrils, or change the angle between your nose and your upper lip. It may also correct a birth defect or injury, or help relieve some breathing problems. Nasal imperfections may be hereditary or due to a history of previous trauma. Changes after rhinoplasty may be subtle or dramatic depending on the patient's needs. The goal of aesthetic rhinoplasty is to create a natural improvement in the appearance of the nose so that it is in balance with the rest of the patient's face.</p>
<p>Septal surgery may be performed alone or in conjunction with a rhinoplasty in order to improve nasal breathing. When surgery is performed in order to correct nasal breathing, some insurance coverage may be available.</p>
<h2>The Consultation</h2>
<p>Rhinoplasty consultation consists of a thorough discussion of the patient's desires and concerns. An extensive evaluation of the patient's nose including photographs, will be performed. The balance between a patient's chin and nose, is also examined. The available surgical options and my recommendations will be reviewed, including the limitations and risks of surgery. Several factors that can influence the type of procedure recommended and the results. These factors include the structure of your nasal bones and cartilage, the shape of your face, the thickness of your skin, your age, and your expectations.</p>
<h2>Who Is An Ideal Candidate?</h2>
<p>The best candidates for rhinoplasty are people who are looking for improvement, not perfection, in the way they look. If you're physically healthy, psychologically stable, and realistic in your expectations, you may be a good candidate.</p>
<h2>The Procedure</h2>
<p>In most cases, rhinoplasty is performed on an outpatient basis. The type of anesthesia used and the location where the surgery is performed depends on the complexity of the procedure. No two noses are the same in appearance and therefore, no two procedures are exactly the same. Rhinoplasty is a very individualized operation. We do not believe in a &quot;cookie cutter&quot; type procedure. During surgery the skin of the nose is separated from its supporting framework of bone and cartilage, which is then sculpted to the desired shape. External and internal nasal splints may be used. These are removed after one week. Packing is rarely performed. The location of incisions and stitches varies and shall be reviewed with the patient during consultation.</p>
<h2>The Recovery</h2>
<p>Discomfort following surgery may vary but it is usually limited. Every patient is discharged home with both verbal and written postoperative instructions. Patients will be seen one week after surgery (sooner if necessary) and for periodic visits for up to one year after surgery. Bruising after surgery usually lasts for about one week. Swelling may persist for several months although this may not be visible to anyone besides the patient. Patients usually are able to return to school or work about 10 days after surgery with some restrictions in their activities. Secondary surgery may be necessary in certain cases.</p>
