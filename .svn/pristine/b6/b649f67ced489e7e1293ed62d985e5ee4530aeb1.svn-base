<p>The Thermage procedure is a new non-invasive treatment for firming the aging skin. Originally, it was developed for use on facial skin, but after a great record of safety and good results, the FDA has now cleared the treatment for use on any area of the body for aging and sagging skin, including the eyes, hands, body, arms, and legs.</p>

<p>Dr. Hyans and Dr. Momeni are both certified Thermage specialists who have the seal of approval (below) for adhering to safe treatment standards.
